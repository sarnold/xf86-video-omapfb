This is xf86-video-omapfb, the Texas Instruments OMAP framebuffer driver
for X.Org.

Roadmap
========

This is a list of plans for the future of the driver.

 - RandR support:
  - Support for multiple outputs
   - Requires DSS kernel API
   - Only cloning for now, since overlays don't have API to set base address
     which would be needed for extending
  - Support display mode switcing
   - For fixed-resolution displays we can use output scaling
  - Support rotation

 - XV support:
  - Support XV on/with multiple outputs (might be impossible)
